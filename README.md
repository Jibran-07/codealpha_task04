Hotel Reservation System

This Java program implements a basic hotel reservation system. Users can search for available rooms, make reservations (with payment processing), view booking details, and exit the system. The program utilizes a menu-driven interface, initializes rooms with categories (Standard or Deluxe), and keeps track of room availability.
